# Final Project
KIEI-451 Winter 2021
Team: Alexandra Krall, Alexis Krushell, Ryan Gillen
App Name: Group Travel App
----------------------------------------------------------------------
***App Description***

An application to help larger groups (5+) plan a trip from start to finish.

Problem: Planning a trip in larger groups can be complicated and move slowly (especially if they happen over a group text), and often not take place due to lost inertia. 

Solution: an app where groups can propose, vote for, and track trip components. 

Some ideas: Initial stages could include things like date selection based on schedules (people could input overall date possibilities), followed by voting for location and housing proposed by group members (this could also include a 1) deadline to sign up 2) price estimation). Then there could be spaces to track and/or coordinate things like flights + rides to and from the airport, activities and restaurants proposed by group members. There could also be a "future trip" bucket.


*****Features/Components*****
- Ability to create a "group"
- Having some kind of "group admin"

	- invites people to join
- All users can add ideas to the shared group list
	- have that user ID shown next to the item on the list, so that everyone can see who added it
	- then after an item is on the list, members can vote on it
- For each list item added, allow the ability to add a URL for other members to get more information on that idea
